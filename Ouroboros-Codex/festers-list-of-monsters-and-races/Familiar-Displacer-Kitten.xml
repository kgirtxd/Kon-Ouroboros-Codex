			<p>Playful, mischievous, and deceptively ferocious, these baby displacer beasts roam freely through the Feywild with their kin. Even in their youth, displacer kittens are trained to hunt with their pride, seeking out and claiming juvenile pegasi and blinkpuppies as their prey.</p>
			<p class="indent">While it is nearly impossible to tame a grown displacer beast, some skilled elves and fey creatures have been known to raise these kittens from infancy as domestic pets, protecting their homes as powerful guard animals. Such exotic pet owners must always beware however, as a displacer beast's feral and malevolent nature runs deep.</p>

			<p>The displacer kitten projects a magical illusion that makes it appear to be standing near its actual location, causing attack rolls against it to have disadvantage. While this trait is active, it is also considered lightly obscured. If it is hit by an attack, this trait is disrupted until the end of its next turn. This trait is also disrupted while the displacer kitten is incapacitated or has a speed of 0.</p>
