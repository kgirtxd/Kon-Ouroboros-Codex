			<p>Blink dog pups are young canines with golden brown fur and long pointed ears. Playful and compassionate, these intelligent pups imprint strongly on their caretakers, developing tremendous loyalty and attachment to those who treat them well and care for them in their early years. Pack hunters by nature, blink dogs are highly communal, and pups do best in small tight-knit packs even when those packs are adoptive. Bright and curious, blink dog pups quickly develop a great love for life and respect for all living things.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Blinking. </strong>From birth, blink dog pups have a natural ability to traverse the veil between worlds, teleporting from one place to another in the blink of an eye. This natural reflxive ability, so crucial to the hunting and fihting prowess of adult blink dogs, is fresh and undeveloped in pups. Pups like to experiment with this ability, using it to play chase, hide-and-seek, and other games with their packmates. Still learning to control their blinking, pups will often reflxively blink a short distance when startled, scared, or even sneezing, with little control over where they end up.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Lost in the Mist. </strong>Blink dog packs are native to the forests at the edge of the Fey Wild, where the separation between the Material Plane and the realm of the fey is thinnest. Occasionally, one of these young pups becomes separated from its pack and strays through the veil, crossing over to the Material Plane. Unable to make their way back home, these isolated pups rarely last long on the Material Plane without a pack to care for them. If found by the wrong party, captured blink dog pups fetch a high market price in both the Fey Wild and the Material Plane.</p>
