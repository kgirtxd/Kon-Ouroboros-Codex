		<description>
			<p><strong>Bottomless Wine.</strong> By itself the Chalice functions as a decanter of endless wine. It will always be at least half full of fine wine and weighs 2 pounds. You can use an action to slosh the wine and speak one of three command words.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"Stream" produces 1 gallon of fine wine.</li>
				<li>"Fountain" produces 5 gallons of fine wine.</li>
				<li>"Geyser" Produces 30 gallons of fine wine that gushes forth in a tower 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the chalice, you can aim the geyser at a creature you san see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone upon which they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become drunken for 1 hour (see below).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Drunkenness.</strong>The target gains disadvantage on all Dexterity saving throws and on skill checks related to the dexterity attribute. They further lose 10 movement per round for the duration of the effect and are unable to concentrate on spells for longer than 1 round. However, they gain advantage on Strength checks and saving throws, and on attacks made using their strength modifier.</p>
			<p><strong>Potion Concentration.</strong>If a potion is mixed with the wine in the chalice its effects will become concentrated by the divine powers of the chalice. If the potion is drunken from the chalice one of the following effects can happen according to the DM's discretion:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The duration of the potion is doubled.</li>
				<li>The damage of a poison is doubled on a failed save.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">It you drink the potion from the chalice you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become drunken (see above). The Chalice no longer holds the effect of the potion stored in it once either one creature drinks from the chalice, or one of the command words are used on the chalice. Using a command word resets the chalice so only fine wine is produced by its bottomless wine effect.</p>
			<p class="indent">If a potion is instead poured out of the Chalice instead of drank, then the chalice will produce 5 vials of the concentrated potions before running out and resetting itself to fine wine. You cannot add concentrated health potions to the chalace.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you use the Bottomless Wine command words while a potion is in the chalice, the contents will revert to wine before the command activates. Thus wasting the stored potion.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This item appears to be a decorative compass with decorative silver banding on its edges. On the banding in primordial script is the phrase "Let he who ask, open the door." While attuned to this item you may ask it a single question a day that fills the following criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li style="margin-left:1em">The question must start with "Where is..." or "What is..."</li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em">The question cannot be answered by a "yes" or "no"</li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em">The answer to the question must exist on the same world and plane that you are on</li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em">The question cannot be phased in such a way as to directly learn the location of a person, creature, or item</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">In the event that the question fill the above requirements, the needle will swivel to point in the direction of the nearest source of knowledge that can be used to either answer the question or point you on the correct path of learning more about the subject matter. In the event that the question does not meet the requirements of the compass, the needle point will fall limp and not point anywhere in particular. The only exception to this is if the knowledge is not located on the same world or plane as it, then it will begin to swivel slowly in a continual circle until asked a new question.</p>

			<p>As one of the oldest divines of Arune, Kira came from the weave into a world that only new life and death. With him, chaos was brought to the world in the form of sudden unpredictabilities in the everyday world. Some people, such as the natives of the Nailen jungles, embraced the every present change. Others, such as the voidist followers in Evelain, sought to remove his presence in thier everyday lives.</p>
		 	<p class="indent">Galeno Lituld, of the Order Oblivion, took it upon himself to end the reign of the god of chaos once and for all. While the original texts portraying the battle have long since been expunged from arune's annals of history, it is still widely known, that the mortal soldier won, but at a great cost. The only renmants le of the divine are trapped within his artifact, waiting to be reborn into the world, and once more bring about the tides of chaos.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Relics of Chaos can be found together in the form of a functioning orb of chaos, or in it's shattered form as the key, ring, and orb of chaos. The key appears as an rectangular curved peice of metal made of bronze with golden inlays. there are indents on the far edges that imply the item is ment to attach to something larger. The Ring of Chaos is bronze with spiraling golden enlays and a suspicious gap in on one side of the lattice work giving it the appearance of a torque. This ring somewhat exible, despite being made of metal and is commonly as a bracelet, armband or necklace depending on the size of the wearer. The Orb of Chaos is a perfect bronze sphere covered in archaic, swirling gold inlay script. Should the artifact be intact, a blocky tarus that changes it's axis of rotation at random spins about the ring.</p>
			<p class="indent">When being used, the inlays of each peice of the artifact will grow with a so prismatic light. To attune to the key or ring of chaos, you must spend a short rest in meditation over the artifacts. In the event that you have the key on your person while trying to attune to the ring, these two artifacts will merge together to form a completed relic. The orb of Chaos is unable to be attuned to unless the full artifact is intact</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The Ring of Chaos has the following random properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li style="margin-left:1em">1 minor beneficial property</li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em">1 minor detremental property</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong><em>Follower of Chaos.</em></strong> While holding this item you're piety with the god Kira is set to a minimum of 3, allowing you to gain the ability to draw the attention of the free spirited god of chaos and manifest his power in the following ways:</p>
			<p class="indent">• <strong>Kira's Acolyte.</strong> You can call on Kira's blessing and cast chaotic bolt with this trait. You can cast the spell in this way a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

			<p class="indent">The Relics of Chaos can be found together in the form of a functioning orb of chaos, or in it's shattered form as the key, ring, and orb of chaos. The key appears as an rectangular curved piece of metal made of bronze with golden inlays. there are indents on the far edges that imply the item is meant to attach to something larger. The Ring of Chaos is bronze with spiraling golden inlays and a suspicious gap in on one side of the lattice work giving it the appearance of a torque. This ring somewhat flexible, despite being made of metal and is commonly as a bracelet, armband or necklace depending on the size of the wearer. The Orb of Chaos is a perfect bronze sphere covered in archaic, swirling gold inlay script. Should the artifact be intact, a blocky tarus that changes it's axis of rotation at random spins about the ring.</p>
			<p class="indent">When being used, the inlays of each piece of the artifact will grow with a soft prismatic light.

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The Ring of Chaos has the following random properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li style="margin-left:1em">1 minor beneficial property</li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em">1 minor detremental property</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong><em>Properties of the Ring.</em></strong> Without the key, the ring bestows the following benefits:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Summon Tempest.</em></strong> As an action you can use the ring to summon a tempest horse to be your steed for 24 hours. Once this trait is used, it can be used again for 5 days. If you have a lawful alignment, the horse has a 50% chance to ignore your orders, including a command to return to the ring. If you attempt to mount the Tempest while it is ignoring your orders, she may attempt to attack you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Gain Proficiency.</em></strong> While attuned to this item you gain proficiency with any two of the following skills; persuasion, deception, intimidation, or insight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Follower of Chaos.</em></strong> While attuned to this item you're piety with the god Kira is set to a minimum of 10, allowing you to gain the ability to draw the attention of the free spirited god of chaos and manifest his power in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li style="margin-left:1em"><em>Kira’s Acolyte</em>. You can call on Kira’s blessing and cast chaotic bolt with this trait. You can cast the spell in this way a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell. </li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong><em>Properties of the Key Ring.</em></strong> If you attempt to attune to the ring while the key is on your character, the two artifacts will magically fuse together, forming a more complete taurus. The two pieces will not be able to be separated except by way of Mordekines Disjointment, DispelMagic, Wish, or Miracle. In addition to the two items becoming one artifact, they bestow the following effects:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Enhanced Proficiency.</em></strong> While attuned to the completed ring you gain proficiency with any two of the following skills; persuasion, deception, intimidation, or insight. If you're already proficient in these skills, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with it. This replaces the incomplete ring's <i>Gain Proficiency</i> feature.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As one of the oldest divines of Arune, Kira came from the weave into a world that only new life and death. With him, chaos was brought to the world in the form of sudden unpredictabilities in the everyday world. Some people, such as the natives of the Nailen jungles, embraced the every present change. Others, such as the voidist followers in Evelain, sought to remove his presence in their everyday lives. </p>
			<p class="indent">Galeno Lituld, of the Order Oblivion, took it upon himself to end the reign of the god of chaos once and for all. While the original texts portraying the battle have long since been expunged from Arune's annals of history, it is still widely known, that the mortal soldier won, but at a great cost. The only remnants left of the divine are trapped within his artifact, waiting to be reborn into the world, and once more bring about the tides of chaos. </p>
			<p class="indent">The Relics of Chaos can be found together in the form of a functioning orb of chaos, or in it's shattered form as the key, ring, and orb of chaos. The key appears as an rectangular curved piece of metal made of bronze with golden inlays. there are indents on the far edges that imply the item is meant to attach to something larger. The Ring of Chaos is bronze with spiraling golden inlays and a suspicious gap in on one side of the lattice work giving it the appearance of a torque. This ring somewhat flexible, despite being made of metal and is commonly as a bracelet, armband or necklace depending on the size of the wearer. The Orb of Chaos is a perfect bronze sphere covered in archaic, swirling gold inlay script. Should the artifact be intact, a blocky tarus that changes it's axis of rotation at random spins about the ring. </p>
			<p class="indent">When being used, the inlays of each piece of the artifact will grow with a soft prismatic light. To attune to the key or ring of chaos, you must spend a short rest in meditation over the artifacts. In the event that you have the key on your person while trying to attune to the ring, these two artifacts will merge together to form a completed relic. The orb of Chaos is unable to be attuned to unless the full artifact is intact. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Properties of the Orb of Chaos.</em></strong> If you are attuned to the completed Orb of Chaos, you receive the following benefits and detriments: </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Gain Proficiency.</em></strong> While You are attune to this item you gain proficiency with any two of the following skills; persuasion, deception, intimidation, or insight. If you're already proficient in that skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with that skill.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Smooth Talker.</em></strong> You gain advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Deception) checks. In addition, when you fail a Charisma saving throw, you can reroll the die, but you must use the new roll. Once you use this reroll, you can't do so again using this ability until you finish a long rest. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Armor of Tempest.</em></strong> You have a +1 to your Armor Class. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Follower of Chaos.</em></strong> While attuned to this item you're piety with the god Kira is set to a minimum of 10, allowing you to gain the ability to draw the attention of the free spirited god of chaos and manifest his power in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li style="margin-left:1em"><em>Kira’s Acolyte</em>. You can call on Kira’s blessing and cast chaotic bolt with this trait. You can cast the spell in this way a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Chaotic Energy.</em></strong>  While you have this item attuned, the following additional effects occur: </p>
			<ul>
				<li style="margin-left:1em">Other creatures can't take a short or long rest within 300 feet of you. </li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em">Your flaw is amplified in a way determined by the DM and is subject to change at each dawn. </li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the Orb.</em></strong> A common rumor among scholars is that the artifact can sense when it is in danger and teleport itself somewhere else in the multiverse. However, if one were to bath the artifact in the blood of Arik, the divine of Law, it would shatter the artifact into three pieces; the orb, the ring, and the key. This renders the orb effectively magicless. To repair the damaged artifact, it requires attuning to all three items and performing the wish spell while inside of a temple of the Kira, the god of chaos. Alternatively, once the pieces are all rejoined, the artifact will naturally repair itself after 1d10x100 years. The pieces will retain their magic so long as chaos still exists in the multiverse</p>

When adorned, the armband will alter its size to the arm or forehead of the creature, allowing it to be worn as either an armband or circlet. when combined with Pharika's mortar and pestle, it will bind to the item making a complete artifact.</p>
			<p class="indent">The mortar and pestle may be found either with or without their inlays, which are most commonly referred to as the Vines of Pharika. Both of the vines and the mortar and pestle share a single attunement slot, allowing 1 creature and up to 2 vine bearers to share the attunement with the mortar and pestle. Attunement breaks to the mortar and pestle each month. Attunement to the vines requires that they be removed from the mortar and pestle and worn on the wrists or arms. Attunement with the vines breaks as soon as the item is removed. </p>
			<p><strong><em>Follower of Affliction.</em></strong> While attuned to this item you're piety with the goddess Pharika is set to a minimum of 10, allowing you to gain the ability to draw the attention of the goddess of affliction and manifest her power in the following ways:</p>

		<description>
			<p>The goddess Pharika was one of two gods that specialized in the sciences in the word of Arune. Legend states that she had an entire alchemists lab dedicated to growing any number of diseases, and a garden that grew an infinite number of herbs that could cure those same diseases. Among her favorite items was a mortar and pestle made of dragon fired glass with a gold inlay of twisting vines on each peice of the set.</p>
			<p class="indent">The mortar and pestle may be found either with or without their inlays, which are most commonly referred to as the Vines of Pharika. Both of the vines and the mortar and pestle share a single attunement slot, allowing 1 creature and up to 2 vine bearers to share the attunement with the mortar and pestle. Attunement breaks to the mortar and pestle each month. Attunement to the vines requires that they be removed from the mortar and pestle and worn on the wrists or arms. Attunement with the vines breaks as soon as the item is removed. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The Mortar and Pestle of Pharika have the following random properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li style="margin-left:1em">2 minor beneficial properties</li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em">1 major beneficial property</li>
				<li style="margin-left:1em">1 minor detremental property</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Properties of the Pestle.</em></strong> The pestle is 6 inches long and made of clear glass. Using a bonus action, this tool may be extended into a dragon glass quarter staff for 10 minutes. When you use this ability you choose whether the damage type is necrotic or radient. This ability can be used a number of times equal to your intelligence modifier (minimum of once). Uses and damage type reset at the next dawn. Whenever the pestle is seperated from the Mortar for more than 1 mile, the pestle will vanish and reappear beside the mortar. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Properties of the Mortar.</em></strong> The mortar is a small glass bowl that automatically changes its size to fit into the hand of the one it is attuned to. If a pinch of common herbs are placed into the mortar, it will multiply the herbs to fill the bowl. The contents of the Mortar will always be enough to produce a single drought of medicine or drink for the creature it is attuned to. In the case of having more than one person attuned to it, the mortar will take on the size of the attunement holder that is last used it. It has 10 charges which can be used in a number of different ways. The mortar regains expended uses at a rate of 1d4 charges per day. </p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Compact Kit.</em></strong>  As a standard action the mortar and pestle can be used in place of a poisoner's kit or a herbalism kit. This trait can be used a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier (minimum of once). Expended uses of this skill recharges after a short or long rest. </p>
