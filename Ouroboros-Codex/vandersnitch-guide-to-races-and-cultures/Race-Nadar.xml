		<description>
			<p>Deep in the lost ruins of Arune there are a people who's blood has been permanently altered by the effects of magical wars long gone. While exceedingly rare, those that do happen across these people will find a fairly content lot, who's highest aspirations tend toward revealing secrets long past and have an uncanny knack for knowing exactly when someone of another plane is speaking to them. </p>
			<h4>HEART OF THE ELEMENTS</h4>
			<p>The Nadar are derived from unions between elemental-touched fey and someone of a humanoid race. They tend to have the thin builds of their fey ancestors and eyes reflecting the elemental plane their blood is touched by. Because of this connection, nadar can take on temporary effects when under high stress such as small flames flickering in their hair, water dripping from their clothes without them becoming wet, a small wind circling around them, or the sounds of a distant earthquake following their footfalls. Eyes tend toward blue/green, amber, brown, and grey/silver, depending on their bloodline. </p>
			<h4>BORN FROM WAR BUT LIVE FOR CHANGE</h4>
			<p>Long ago before the fey and the elves got along there was a war between the two races. Fey, with their deep rooted connection to the outer planes, took to making pacts with ancient primordials of the elemental planes for assistance. Now, many years later, the union of outer planar and material planar blood has caused the creation of the nadar. </p>
			<p class="indent">Those of this bloodline are usually found in the deepest forests and untouched wanders of nature where only the fey and some elves dare to live. Their connection to the elemental planes tends to give the primordial touched, chaotic natures and a desire to stay in locations close to the homeland of the original Primordial that began their lineage. </p>
			<p class="indent">In cities the nadar have difficulty staying with one job for too long. They typically take up interests in artisan crafts where they are free to craft what their hearts' desire and make excellent adventurers where they make their homes on the road looking for lost ruins and dungeons to delve. </p>
