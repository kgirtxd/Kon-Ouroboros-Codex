			<p>You're patron imbues you with a primordial connection to the elemental planes of existence gifting resistance against poison and advantage on rolls against poisonous effects both mundane and magical. </p>
			<p class="indent">You've made a pact with an ancient being of the four elemental planes of existence. This being's whims are unknowable to all but themselves as they do not strive toward exclusively good, evil, lawful, or chaotic ends. Such beings typically desire the preservation of raw, unchanged natural areas akin to their own planes. The primordial is of a class of elementals powerful enough to forge pacts through their ancient power, having grown so large that they have blurred the egdes of thier original planes and have taken on aspects of each of the elemental planes. </p>
