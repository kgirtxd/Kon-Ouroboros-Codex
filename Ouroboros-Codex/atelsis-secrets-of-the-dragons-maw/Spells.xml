            <p>Chaotic currents of time rip through a 20-foot-sphere. Each creature in the sphere on the turn when you cast the spell must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 force damage, and its speed is halved until the end of the next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no reduction to its speed.</p>
            <p class="indent">Until the start of your next turn, any creature outside the sphere attempting to pick up an object in the sphere that isn’t being worn or carried must make a successful Strength check against your spell save DC to pick up or move that object.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
